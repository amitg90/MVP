The main theme of the project is to give an idea about MVP design pattern works.

In the meanwhile, we can also see additional concepts such as DataBinding, CheckStyles.


MVP : Model- View - Presenter

    1. Model - Responsible for managing the data.
    2. Presenter - It is the middle-man between model and view.
              -It is responsible for querying the model and updating the view, reacting to user interactions updating the model.
    3. View - Responsible for presenting data in a way decided by the presenter


 CheckStyles : Used to follow proper coding styles in the project.

 DataBinding : provides flexibility and broad compatibility.
